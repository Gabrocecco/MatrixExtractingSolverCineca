convertSystem

This is an OF utility to convert the OF format system dumps into two
simple text files, one for the matrix and the other for the vector.

COMPILATION:

 - Ensure OpenFOAM has initialised your shell (i.e. you've sourced
   $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/bashrc).

 - Run wmake

USAGE:

 - On the commandline, from the case directory, run with
   "convertSystem"

 - Use the "-help" option for detailed usage. Options work as for
   reconstructPar to select times to convert. Does not have the
   field selection options.

 - The "-format" option control output. Options are:
   * ascii - plain text
   * binary - raw, unstructured binary format in the platform's default format
   * numpy - Numpy format (read with numpy.load function)
   
 - Note that if you are processing a parallel run, you must have first
   run reconstructSystem.

OUTPUT:

 - For every .system file, creates a .coo file (the matrix, in COO
   format, i.e. "row col val" triples, one per line) and a .vec file
   (one entry per line).
