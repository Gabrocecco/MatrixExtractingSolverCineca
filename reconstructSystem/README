reconstructSystem

THis is an OF utility to reassemble the output of a parallel run into
a single file (a la reconstructPar).

COMPILATION:

 - Ensure OpenFOAM has initialised your shell (i.e. you've sourced
   $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/bashrc).

 - Create symbolic links (in this directory) to the
   processorMeshes.{H,C} files which are part of reconstructPar's
   implementation.
   
   ln -s $FOAM_APP/utilities/parallelProcessing/reconstructPar/processorMeshes.H
   ln -s $FOAM_APP/utilities/parallelProcessing/reconstructPar/processorMeshes.C

 - Run wmake

USAGE:

 - On the commandline, from the case directory, run with
   "reconstructSystem"

 - Use the "-help" option for detailed usage. Options work as for
   reconstructPar to select times to reconstruct. Does not have the
   field selection options.

OUTPUT:

 - Creates time directories in the case top level corresponding to
   those selected from the per-processor databases.
