You must create symbolic links (in this directory) to the processorMeshes.{H,C} files which are part of reconstructPar's implementation.

ln -s $FOAM_APP/utilities/parallelProcessing/reconstructPar/processorMeshes.H
ln -s $FOAM_APP/utilities/parallelProcessing/reconstructPar/processorMeshes.C

Then you can run wmake.
