Simple OpenFOAM solver that allows extraction of the linear system
matrix and source terms to a file.

It delegates the actual solution of the system to a real solver as
specified by the "worker" keyword in the case's system/fvSolution
dictionary.

LIMITATIONS:

 - Only allows one solution of each problem matrix - on the second
   attempt it will bring down the solver
   
 - Almost certainly doesn't work in parallel

COMPILATION:

 - Ensure OpenFOAM has initialised your shell (i.e. you've sourced
   $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/bashrc).

 - Make the shared object with "wmake libso"

USAGE:

 - Go to the case you want to extract the matrix from

 - Tell OpenFOAM to load the shared library by adding:
   libs(
    "libMatrixExtractingSolver.so"
   );
   to 'system/controlDict'.

 - Edit 'system/fvSolution' to replace the solver of interest with
   MatrixExtractingSolver and place the original solver's parameters
   in a subdictionary under the keyword "worker".

   For example
   Old "system/fvSolution":

// Headers etc...
solvers
{
    p
    {
        solver          PCG;
        preconditioner  DIC;
        tolerance       1e-06;
        relTol          0;
    }
    
    // Other solvers...
}


    New system/fvSolution:
// Headers etc...
solvers
{
    p
    {
        solver          MatrixExtractingSolver;
	worker
        {
          solver          PCG;
          preconditioner  DIC;
          tolerance       1e-06;
          relTol          0;
	}
    }
    
    // Other solvers...
}
